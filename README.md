This project is focused on analyzing and predicting the popularity of songs on Spotify using various metrics. The work is divided into two main parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The first part of the project involves an exploratory analysis of the most popular songs currently on Spotify. For this analysis, we use a dataset that is updated daily, allowing us to understand trends, patterns, and characteristics of top-performing tracks.

Dataset: [Top Spotify Songs in 73 Countries (Daily Updated)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/top-spotify-songs-in-73-countries-daily-updated)

2. Machine Learning Model:
The second part of the project leverages another dataset to build a machine learning model aimed at predicting song popularity. The model utilizes a variety of metrics, including:

* duration_ms (song duration)
* danceability (suitability for dancing)
* energy (intensity and activity)
* key (musical key of the track)
* loudness (overall volume level)
* tempo (speed in beats per minute)
* mode (major or minor key)
* speechiness (presence of spoken words)
* acousticness (likelihood of being acoustic)
* instrumentalness (instrumental content)
* liveness (probability of being live)
* valence (musical positiveness)
* time_signature (beats per measure)

By analyzing these features, the project aims to accurately model and predict the future popularity of songs on Spotify.
